*tselectfiles.txt*  A simplicistic files selector/browser (sort of)
                    Author: Thomas Link, micathom at gmail com


This plugin provides a simple file browser. It is not a full blown 
explorer but can be nevertheless be useful for quickly selecting a few 
files or renaming them.

As the plugin does some caching in the background, the filelist is only 
generated once for each path or when called with [!]. In conjuncture 
with the use of the [wbg]:tselectfile_filter_rx variable, this provides 
for use as a simple ad-hoc project manager.

EXAMPLE:
When opening a file under "~/vimfiles", I set b:tselectfiles_dir 
to all the relevant directories under "~/vimfiles" and then set 
b:tselectfile_filter_rx = expand('%:t:r'). Thus, when I open 
"~/vimfiles/plugin/foo.vim", b:tselectfile_filter_rx is "foo", and 
:TSelectFiles shows all the files under "~/vimfiles" matching "foo".

Features:
    - list files, dynamically select files matching a pattern
    - open files
    - preview files
    - rename/move files
    - batch rename/move files (using a regular expression)
    - copy files
    - delete files
    - show file info

g:tselectfiles_use_cache       (default: 1)
    Whether to cache directory listings (in memory). (per buffer, global)
    If 0, disable the use of cached file listings all together.

                                                    *g:tselectfiles_no_cache_rx*
g:tselectfiles_no_cache_rx     (default: '')
    Don't use the cache for directories matching this rx. (per buffer, 
    global)

                                                    *g:tselectfiles_filter_rx*
g:tselectfiles_filter_rx       (default: '')
    Retain only files matching this rx. (per window, per buffer, global)

                                                    *TSelectFiles()*

:TSelectFiles[!] [DIR]
    Open/delete/rename files in the current directory.
    A [!] forces the commands to rescan the directory. Otherwise a cached 
    value will be used if available.
    You can also type <c-r> to force rescanning a directory, which could 
    be necessary if the file system were changed (e.g. by creating a new 
    file or by some external command)

                                                    *:TSelectFilesInSubdirs*
:TSelectFilesInSubdirs
    Recursively show all files in the current directory and subdirectories 
    (don't show favourites and ".."); don't use this command when you're 
    at /.
    A [!] forces the commands to rescan the directory. Otherwise a cached 
    value will be used if available.
